  <h2>What is CCTV water pipe leak detection?</h2>
  <p>CCTV water pipe leak detection uses a small camera to inspect hidden pipes. This lets you spot tiny cracks, holes, and loose joints where water may escape. The flexible camera cable threads through pipes and shows a live video feed. You see problems without heavy digging.</p>
  <p>CCTV pipe checks work on water supply and drain lines in walls, underground, and under slabs. You can spot leaks early before they soak floors or harm foundations. Finding leaks fast cuts repair time and costs. Many homeowners check spots without tearing out walls.</p>
  <h3>What does CCTV mean in leak checks?</h3>
  <p>CCTV stands for closed-circuit television. It means the camera sends a private video feed to a screen. In leak checks, the camera feeds live video from inside the pipe to a monitor outside. This lets you see damage as it happens without opening walls or floors.</p>
  <h3>How does the camera spot leaks inside pipes?</h3>
  <p>The camera has a bright light on its tip to light the pipe’s interior. As you push the cable, the lens shows bends, cracks, and wet spots on the monitor. You watch for drips, loose joints, and worn areas. Any tear or hole that lets water out shows up clearly.</p>
  <h3>Where can this check be used around a home?</h3>
  <p>You can run the camera through water lines under sinks, showers, and toilets. It also works in drain lines in walls and under driveways. CCTV can inspect pipes under slabs and around foundations. Homeowners even use it in irrigation lines to find hidden breaks.</p>

  <h2>Why use CCTV water pipe leak detection?</h2>
  <p>CCTV water pipe leak detection shows leaks fast and removes guesswork. Unlike methods that rely on sound, like <a href="/blog/acoustic-leak-detection-find-hidden-leaks/">acoustic leak detection</a>, it gives a live video of the problem. You see the exact spot where water escapes, even in tight turns and long runs. This direct view guides the repair.</p>
  <p>This method cuts repair costs by limiting damage to walls and landscaping. You avoid big digs by opening only a small spot. CCTV checks also speed up the search so you spend less time hunting leaks. You can fix leaks the same day you spot them.</p>
  <h3>How does it cut down on digging work?</h3>
  <p>Instead of guessing, the camera shows the exact leak spot. You dig just one small hole to insert the cable and one spot to repair. This avoids tearing up large sections of lawn or floor. Less digging means you can get back to normal faster.</p>
  <h3>Can it show leaks hidden under floors or walls?</h3>
  <p>Yes. The camera can work through small cleanouts under floors or behind walls. It sends a feed to a monitor so you can view under slabs. With careful feeding, you can spot leaks under concrete or tile without big cuts. Walls stay intact.</p>
  <h3>Will it help stop small leaks from growing?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Finding drips and pinholes early lets you repair before water spreads. Early fixes stop damp spots that lead to mold or rot. The video also shows slow drips you might miss. Stopping leaks early saves money and protects your home.</p>

  <h2>How to do CCTV water pipe leak detection step by step</h2>
  <p>To do CCTV water pipe leak detection yourself, find a cleanout or access point. Attach the camera to its cable and turn on the monitor. Feed the camera slowly into the line while watching the screen. Stop when you see wet patches, cracks, or loose sections.</p>
  <p>Mark the exact spot on the ground or wall for repair. Pull out the camera, note the pipe size and material, and clean the lens. You can add <a href="/blog/electronic-leak-detection-methods/">electronic leak detection methods</a> that sense signals or pressure changes for more accuracy. If you hit a tight bend, pull the cable back and try a new angle.</p>
  <h3>What simple tools do I need for a camera check?</h3>
  <p>You need a small pipe camera kit with a camera head, cable reel, and monitor. You also need a power pack or battery. Have a flashlight and gloves for setup and cleanup. A bucket and towel help catch drips near access points.</p>
  <h3>What order of steps should I follow for an inspection?</h3>
  <p>First, clear the access point and shut off water if needed. Second, turn on the camera and set the brightness. Third, feed the camera slowly and watch for damage. Fourth, note any leaks and mark the entry depth. Last, turn off the gear and clean the camera before you pack it away.</p>
  <h3>How do I read the camera screen for signs of leaks?</h3>
  <p>On screen, look for dark wet spots and dripping water. Watch for breaks in pipe walls, loose joints, and rust spots. Slow-moving water can mean a leak even without a stream. Pause the feed to study any odd shapes or stains.</p>

  <h2>How to stay safe during CCTV water pipe leak detection</h2>
  <p>Before opening any cleanout, turn off the main water. Wear gloves and eye protection against dirty water. Keep tools dry and off wet floors to avoid slips. Read the camera guide for safe handling.</p>
  <p>Make sure your power pack is charged and cords are not frayed. Place the monitor on a stable surface away from water. Keep the cable untangled so it feeds smoothly. If you work in a damp basement or under a slab, use a GFCI outlet.</p>
  <h3>What quick checks protect you before you start?</h3>
  <p>Check that all power cords and plugs are dry and in good shape. Clear the work area of tools that could trip you. Make sure the camera lens is clean before feeding it in. Read the manual for any safety warnings on pressure or water flow.</p>
  <h3>How should you handle the camera and cable safely?</h3>
  <p>Hold the camera head gently and avoid dropping it. Guide the cable by hand, not by pulling from the reel, to prevent kinks. Do not bend the cable sharply or you may break its fibers. Clean and dry the cable before rolling it back on the reel.</p>
  <h3>When should you call an expert for help?</h3>
  <p>If you cannot find a clear leak or the camera gets stuck, get help. Call an expert if you spot heavy root damage or a collapsed pipe. Also call when the leak is under a slab you can’t reach safely. A pro has more tools to avoid damage.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>CCTV water pipe leak detection makes finding hidden leaks easier and faster. It cuts digging, guides precise repairs, and saves money. By giving you a live pipe view, it helps fix small drips before they grow. This simple camera check protects your home and wallet.</p>
  <p>Start small by checking one line or fitting at a time. Learn the signs on your screen and mark where repairs go. Handle gear safely and keep tools dry. With a little practice, you can spot trouble early and keep pipes in good shape long term.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
  <h3>How much does DIY camera leak detection cost?</h3>
  <p>A basic home camera kit costs $200 to $800, based on cable length and screen size. You can rent a kit for about $50 a day if you only need it once. Buying gear pays off if you plan to check more than one leak.</p>
  <h3>Can a small pinpoint leak show up on camera?</h3>
  <p>A tiny pinhole leak may be hard to spot on screen. Look for slow water flow or dark wet spots that grow over time when pipes are off. Pausing the feed in one spot can make drips more visible.</p>
  <h3>Do I need to turn off my water for the check?</h3>
  <p>You usually leave the water on to see where leaks flow. But to spot drips in standing water, shut off the main valve first. Then any moving water on screen shows the leak.</p>
  <h3>How deep can the camera see under slabs?</h3>
  <p>The camera rides inside the pipe, so it shows where the pipe runs, not under slab layers. It works as deep as the cable reaches, often 100 to 200 feet. Cable length matters more than slab depth when you check under slabs.</p>
  <h3>What if the pipe bends too sharply for the camera?</h3>
  <p>Sharp bends can stop some camera heads. Try feeding slower and twisting the cable gently to ease around curves. If it still won’t pass, use a smaller camera head if your kit allows. Otherwise, call a pro with a more flexible snake camera.</p>
  <h3>How do I clean the camera lens after use?</h3>
  <p>First, wipe the lens with a soft, lint-free cloth. If it is grimy, use a drop of mild soap and water, then rinse. Dry it fully before storing to keep the view clear next time.</p>
  <h3>Can I use a smartphone adapter instead of a full kit?</h3>
  <p>Yes. You can attach a small camera head to some smartphones, but cable length and lighting may be limited. A full CCTV kit gives longer reach and brighter lights for deep pipes. A phone adapter can work for quick checks on short sections.</p>
