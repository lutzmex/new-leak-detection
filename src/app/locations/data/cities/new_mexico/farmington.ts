    },
    {

      question: "What leak detection methods do you use?",
      answer: "We use electronic listening devices, thermal cameras, ground radar and tracer gas as needed. These tools let us find leaks under walls, slabs and underground with no damage. We pick the best method for your pipes and location."
    },
    {
      question: "Will leak detection damage my property?",

    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is electronic leak detection?",
      answer: "Electronic listening and thermal scans let us pinpoint leak locations within inches. Ground radar and tracer gas can narrow underground leaks to the right spot in your yard. We test points twice to ensure confidence before any repair."
