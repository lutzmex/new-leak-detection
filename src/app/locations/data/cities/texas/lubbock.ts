      answer: "Yes, we serve every corner of Lubbock, including Downtown, Tech Terrace, Raintree, and more. Our team travels to all neighborhoods so you get fast help wherever you live. Just call us and we will schedule same day service."
    },
    {
      question: "What areas of TX do you service?",
      answer: "Our main area covers Lubbock, Wolfforth, and nearby towns in Lubbock County. We also help customers in Shallowater, Slaton, and Idalou when they need fast leak detection. If you are in West Texas near Lubbock, give us a call."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can you respond to leak emergencies?",
      answer: "We answer calls 24/7 and try to arrive within two hours for emergencies in the Lubbock city limits. Our trucks stay on call to reach your home fast, day or night. If you need help right away, just call our emergency line."
    },
    {
      question: "What leak detection methods do you use?",
      answer: "We use acoustic listening sensors, pressure decay tests, thermal cameras, and video cameras to find leaks without damage. We also run radar and helium tracer tests for tricky slab and underground leaks. Each method fits the leak type so we find your leak fast."
    },
    {
      question: "Will leak detection damage my property?",
      answer: "No, our goal is to keep your home intact using noninvasive methods like listening tools, cameras, and thermal scans. We only cut small test holes when needed and patch them cleanly. Most leaks are found without any drilling."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is electronic leak detection?",
      answer: "Electronic leak detection is very accurate when done by licensed technicians. Our amplifiers and sensors can pick up drips in walls and slabs down to pinhole size. We combine it with other tests for a precise leak location every time."
    },
    {
      question: "What factors determine leak detection costs?",
      answer: "Costs depend on the leak type, its location, and the test methods needed. A simple under sink leak detection is less than a slab leak test that needs radar and cameras. We give clear estimates before work so you know the price."

      question: "Do you provide leak repair services too?",
      answer: "Yes, we fix leaks on the same day whenever possible. Our team carries repair parts for water, gas, pool, and slab leaks. You get both leak detection and repair in one visit to save time and money."
