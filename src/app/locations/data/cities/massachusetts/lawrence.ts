      answer: "No, our methods are noninvasive and protect your home. We use electronic tools that listen for leaks without drilling. Thermal imaging and video cameras inspect pipes with minimal disruption. We only dig when we must access the leak for repair."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is electronic leak detection?",
      answer: "Electronic leak detection is highly accurate when done by trained technicians. Our tools detect sound waves and pressure changes to pinpoint leaks within inches. We cross check results with thermal imaging to confirm. This reduces guesswork and keeps repairs precise."
    },
    {
