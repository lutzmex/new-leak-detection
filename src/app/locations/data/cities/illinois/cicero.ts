      question: "Will leak detection damage my property?",
      answer: "No, leak detection is non invasive, and we avoid random digging. Our acoustic and thermal tools locate leaks under floors, walls, and slabs without harm. If a repair needs spot work, we cut small openings and patch the area when we finish."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is electronic leak detection?",
      answer: "Electronic detection is precise down to one inch, so we know exactly where to dig or repair. Acoustic listening and pressure testing let us confirm readings before we break concrete. That reduces repair time and cost."
    },
    {
      question: "What factors determine leak detection costs?",
      answer: "Cost depends on leak type, location, and access difficulty. Water, pool, gas, and slab leaks each take different gear and time. We give a clear estimate after our initial assessment. Most basic checks start at a flat rate."

      answer: "Yes, we offer free estimates for standard leak detection in Cicero, IL. Our tech visits your property to assess the leak and then provides a written estimate at no charge. You decide if you want to proceed with repair, and we schedule work once you approve."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I prepare for a leak detection appointment?",
      answer: "Please clear any items from around fixtures, walls, and the suspected leak area so our tech can work safely. We ask that someone be home to grant access to basements, crawl spaces, and utility closets. You can note water spots or times when you saw the leak."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with insurance companies?",
      answer: "Yes, we can provide detailed reports, photos, and readings to support water or gas damage claims. We work with most home insurance providers in Illinois and can send data directly to your adjuster. Ask us how to include our detection report in your claim."
    },
    {
