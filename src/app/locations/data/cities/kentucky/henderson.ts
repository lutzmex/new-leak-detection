    },
    {
      question: "Will leak detection damage my property?",
      answer: "No, we use tools that find leaks without major digging or cutting. We scan walls floors and slabs before any drilling. If we must cut concrete or drywall we make small openings and restore the surface. We keep your property neat."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is electronic leak detection?",
      answer: "Electronic methods can pinpoint leaks within a few inches. Our listening tools pick up drips behind walls and under floors. We combine tests to be sure of the exact spot. That means faster repairs and less work on your property."
    },
    {
      question: "What factors determine leak detection costs?",
      answer: "Costs depend on leak type location and access. Hidden slab leaks under concrete take more time than simple line tests. Pool and gas leaks may need special sensors. We share a clear quote before we start. You will know total cost up front."

    },
    {
      question: "How long does a leak detection appointment take?",
      answer: "Most leak tests take about one to two hours. Large slab or pool scans may need more time but we keep you updated. We work carefully to find the leak site and show you the result. We wrap up with a report and clear plan."
