    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is electronic leak detection?",
      answer: "Our acoustic and electronic sensors can locate leaks within inches. We amplify subtle pipe sounds and map them precisely. This gives us exact spots to dig and keeps repair work small and fast."
    },
    {
      question: "What factors determine leak detection costs?",
      answer: "Leak detection costs depend on leak type, depth, and access conditions. Slab or pool leaks need special tools. After we assess the issue, we give you a clear price. Emergency or after hours calls may include an extra fee."

      answer: "Yes, we repair leaks we find in water, gas, pool, and slab systems. Our vans carry repair parts and tools for most jobs. You deal with one team from detection through the final fix."

    },
    {
      question: "Can you detect leaks under concrete slabs without breaking the floor?",
      answer: "Yes, we use acoustic sensors and thermal imaging to find slab leaks under concrete. We pinpoint the leak so we cut only a small repair hole. This keeps your slab intact and speeds up the fix."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer warranty on leak detection and repair work?",
      answer: "We offer a one year warranty on detection and repair work. If a leak resurfaces, we return and fix it at no extra cost. Our goal is your complete satisfaction and peace of mind."
