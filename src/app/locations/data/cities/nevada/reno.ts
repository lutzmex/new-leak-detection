    },
    {
      question: "What leak detection methods do you use?",
      answer: "We use acoustic listening, thermal imaging, electronic amplification, helium gas tracing, and pressure decay testing. We also inspect pipes with video cameras. This mix lets us find leaks in walls, under slabs, or underground."
    },
    {
      question: "Will leak detection damage my property?",
      answer: "No. We use non invasive techniques that avoid major digs or wall cuts. Most leaks are found with listening gear or thermal scans. If a repair requires a small hole, we patch it to a paint ready condition."

    {
      question: "How accurate is electronic leak detection?",
      answer: "Electronic methods can locate leaks within inches of their source. Our amplifiers and sensors detect even faint water or gas flow. This accuracy saves time, reduces repair scope, and cuts your costs."
    },
    {

      answer: "Cost depends on leak type, location, and access. Simple water line tests cost less than slab or pool leak work. We offer free phone estimates and clear pricing before any work starts."

      answer: "Yes. We handle both detection and repair in one visit. Our team fixes pipes, seals leaks, and works with local foundation or pool specialists for a full service. You get a one stop solution."
    },
    {
      question: "Are leak detection estimates free?",

    },
    {
      question: "Can you find leaks under concrete slabs?",
      answer: "Yes. We use listening devices, helium tracing, and pressure tests to find under slab leaks without major breaks. We mark the exact point so repair crews can make minimal cuts and restore your concrete quickly."
