  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What is thermal imaging leak detection?',
      answer: 'Thermal imaging leak detection uses infrared cameras to spot temperature differences caused by moisture. Our tech scans floors, walls, and ceilings to find hidden leaks without damage. You get clear images and locations for repairs.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a thermal imaging scan take?',
      answer: 'A typical thermal imaging scan takes 30 to 60 minutes depending on property size. We review images on site and mark leak spots in real time. You get a report before we leave.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is thermal imaging noninvasive?',
      answer: 'Yes. Thermal imaging is noninvasive and does not require drilling or cutting. Our cameras see through surfaces to detect moisture and leaks. This protects your floors, walls, and ceilings from damage.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to prepare my home before a scan?',
      answer: 'No major prep is needed. Clear furniture or items away from walls and floors in the scan area. We handle the rest. This helps our tech get clear thermal images and speeds up the process.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I see the thermal images?',
      answer: 'Yes. We show you live thermal images on a tablet during the scan. You get to see where the leak is and what the colors mean. Later you receive an easy report with selected images.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does thermal imaging leak detection cost?',
      answer: 'Our flat fee covers the full thermal scan, on site analysis, and a report. Rates start at a fair rate for most homes. You know the cost before we start and pay one clear fee.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Will insurance cover thermal imaging?',
      answer: 'Some insurance policies cover leak detection costs. We provide a report and images you can submit. Check your policy or ask your agent. We also help explain findings if needed.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What if no leak is found?',
      answer: 'If our scan shows no leaks, you still get the thermal images and a clear report. We explain possible reasons such as seasonal moisture or false alarms. There is no extra charge to scan other areas.'
