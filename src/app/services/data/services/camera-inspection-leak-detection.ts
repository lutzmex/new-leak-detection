  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What is camera inspection leak detection?',
      answer: 'Camera inspection leak detection uses a small video camera on a flexible cable to inspect the inside of pipes. We feed the camera through cleanouts or drains to spot cracks, blockages, or leaks. You get live video and a detailed report showing the exact problem area.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is camera inspection invasive to my property?',
      answer: 'The process is non intrusive and avoids major digging. We use existing access points like cleanouts, sinks, or toilets to feed the camera. This protects your landscape, floors, and walls from unneeded damage.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does a camera inspection cost?',
      answer: 'Camera inspection rates vary by pipe length and line type. They typically start under a flat fee for basic lines. Our budget friendly rates and upfront quotes let you see the cost before work starts. No surprise upcharges for extra footage.'
    },

      answer: 'We offer fast scheduling and same day service for urgent leaks when available. Standard bookings often fall within one to two business days. Our 24 7 emergency response team handles calls any time you need quick help.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to do anything before the inspection?',
      answer: 'Please clear the area around drains or cleanouts so technicians can work easily. For indoor lines leave under sink cabinets open and remove items from the floor. Our team guides you through any special prep during booking.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Will I receive video footage?',
      answer: 'Yes, you receive clear video clips and still images in a written report. We timestamp key problem spots and note the distance from access points. This visual document helps you and any repair crew know exactly where to work.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can camera inspection find deep underground leaks?',
      answer: 'Our distance marked cable reels travel hundreds of feet into buried pipes. The video feed tells us how far the camera goes before it sees a crack or hole. This lets us locate underground leaks under driveways or lawns with precision.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are your technicians certified?',
      answer: 'Yes, our camera inspection leak detection technicians hold industry training and certifications. They follow licensed and insured protocols on every job. You can trust their skill to run the gear and document findings accurately.'
