  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What is pressure testing and how does it work?',
      answer: 'Pressure testing checks if pipes hold water or air under set pressure. We fill lines and watch gauges to spot any pressure loss. This shows if you have leaks or weak spots.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a pressure test take?',
      answer: 'Most tests take one to two hours depending on system size. We set pressure, watch it for a set time, and record results. You get a clear report at the end.'

      answer: 'You only need to clear floor areas and move items away from pipes. Our team handles valves and covers floors. Your other rooms stay undisturbed.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I know if my system needs pressure testing?',
      answer: 'Call us if you see low water pressure, wet spots or high bills. We run a quick test to see if lines hold pressure. This tells you if you have hidden leaks.'
